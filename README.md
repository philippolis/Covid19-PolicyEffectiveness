# Covid19-PolicyEffectiveness
 
This is an analysis of the effect of COVID-19-related non-pharmaceutical policies on the time-variable reproduction rate in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

It shows differing lags at which changes in policy stringency result in changes in the reproduction rate, and different strengths of effect of these changes. 

These findings can be interpreted as differences in policy effectiveness both in terms of how quickly the reproduction rate reacted to changes in policy stringency and in terms of how strongly changes in policy stringency affected the reproduction rate across these four countries.
