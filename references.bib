  year = {2021},

  abstract = {In statistics, a vector of random variables is heteroscedastic (or heteroskedastic; from Ancient Greek hetero "different" and skedasis "dispersion") if the variability of the random disturbance is different across elements of the vector.  Here, variability could be quantified by the variance or any other measure of statistical dispersion. Thus heteroscedasticity is the absence of homoscedasticity. A typical example is the set of observations of income in different cities. The existence of heteroscedasticity is a major concern in   regression analysis and the analysis of variance, as it invalidates statistical tests of significance that assume that the modelling errors all have the same variance. While the ordinary least squares estimator is still unbiased in the presence of heteroscedasticity, it is inefficient and generalized least squares should be used instead.Because heteroscedasticity concerns expectations of the second moment of the errors, its presence is referred to as misspecification of the second order.The econometrician Robert Engle won the 2003 Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics for his studies on regression analysis in the presence of heteroscedasticity, which led to his formulation of the autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) modeling technique.},

  abstract = {Background Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were implemented by many countries to reduce the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19. A resurgence in COVID-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs. We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number (R), from a broad perspective across 131 countries. Methods In this modelling study, we linked data on daily country-level estimates of R from the London School of Hygiene \& Tropical Medicine (London, UK) with data on country-specific policies on NPIs from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, available between Jan 1 and July 20, 2020. We defined a phase as a time period when all NPIs remained the same, and we divided the timeline of each country into individual phases based on the status of NPIs. We calculated the R ratio as the ratio between the daily R of each phase and the R from the last day of the previous phase (ie, before the NPI status changed) as a measure of the association between NPI status and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We then modelled the R ratio using a log-linear regression with introduction and relaxation of each NPI as independent variables for each day of the first 28 days after the change in the corresponding NPI. In an ad-hoc analysis, we estimated the effect of reintroducing multiple NPIs with the greatest effects, and in the observed sequence, to tackle the possible resurgence of SARS-CoV-2. Findings 790 phases from 131 countries were included in the analysis. A decreasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the introduction of school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the reduction in R ranged from 3\% to 24\% on day 28 following the introduction compared with the last day before introduction, although the reduction was significant only for public events ban (R ratio 0{$\cdot$}76, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}58\textendash 1{$\cdot$}00); for all other NPIs, the upper bound of the 95\% CI was above 1. An increasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the relaxation of school closure, bans on public events, bans on public gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the increase in R ranged from 11\% to 25\% on day 28 following the relaxation compared with the last day before relaxation, although the increase was significant only for school reopening (R ratio 1{$\cdot$}24, 95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}00\textendash 1{$\cdot$}52) and lifting bans on public gatherings of more than ten people (1{$\cdot$}25, 1{$\cdot$}03\textendash 1{$\cdot$}51); for all other NPIs, the lower bound of the 95\% CI was below 1. It took a median of 8 days (IQR 6\textendash 9) following the introduction of an NPI to observe 60\% of the maximum reduction in R and even longer (17 days [14\textendash 20]) following relaxation to observe 60\% of the maximum increase in R. In response to a possible resurgence of COVID-19, a control strategy of banning public events and public gatherings of more than ten people was estimated to reduce R, with an R ratio of 0{$\cdot$}71 (95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}55\textendash 0{$\cdot$}93) on day 28, decreasing to 0{$\cdot$}62 (0{$\cdot$}47\textendash 0{$\cdot$}82) on day 28 if measures to close workplaces were added, 0{$\cdot$}58 (0{$\cdot$}41\textendash 0{$\cdot$}81) if measures to close workplaces and internal movement restrictions were added, and 0{$\cdot$}48 (0{$\cdot$}32\textendash 0{$\cdot$}71) if measures to close workplaces, internal movement restrictions, and requirements to stay at home were added. Interpretation Individual NPIs, including school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, ban on gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits, are associated with reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but the effect of introducing and lifting these NPIs is delayed by 1\textendash 3 weeks, with this delay being longer when lifting NPIs. These findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy-maker decisions on the timing of introducing and lifting different NPIs, although R should be interpreted in the context of its known limitations.

However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories.                                         Methods                                We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission using data from January to June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (                 R                                    t                                  ) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in                 R                                    t                                  , levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect, and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs.                                                        Results                                There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced                 R                                    t                                  . Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support, and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g. restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on {$<$}\,10 people gathering were). Evidence about the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Effect sizes varied depending on whether or not we included data after peak NPI intensity.                                                        Conclusion               Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects, and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many, although not all, actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.},

  abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 has called for swift action by governments, often involving the adoption of restrictive measures such as lockdowns. In this context, leaders have faced a trade-off between imposing stringent measures to limit the contagion, and minimizing the short-run costs on their national economy, which could impact their electoral prospects. Leveraging on both the timing of elections and the constitutional term limits faced by leaders in presidential systems, we document how incumbents who can run for re-election implement less stringent restrictions when the election is closer in time. The effect is driven by measures more likely to have a negative economic impact. This shows how electoral concerns help explain the observed differences in the response to the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic across different countries.},
